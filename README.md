# Case Study: Chasing-Bigfoot


# Overview

In this case study we were tasked with using unstructured data to answer any questions that we thought might be interesting.  We could use either UFO or Bigfoot data.


# Motivation

This project was meant to simulate the very real situation where we might be given very vague instructions with some data and need to find some insight or interesting trends in the data.  We also had some practice with web-scrapping and parsing through forum or text data.


# Data

We were tasked with web-scraping data from either UFO sighting websites or Bigfoot sighting websites.  We decided to work with the Bigfoot data found at this website: http://www.bfro.net/gdb/.
